                    <p>While working as a Web Developer/Handler at Everlife Energy India Pvt Limited in India, I have gained substantial experience identifying and fixing bugs, as well as coding in Java, Python, and C - all skills I’m confident would be useful throughout my career. Additionally, I leveraged my knowledge of other languages to help myself to be able to work in different environments as needed.</p>
                    <p>While working at Everlife Energy India Pvt Limited I have had professional exposure in the field of Computer Science and at Rutgers, I learned to lead teams on group projects where we fixed bugs, implemented UI enhancements, maintained pages via WordPress, and used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and enhance web pages plus using AWS to host the databases and the site.</p>
                    <p>Interning at few companies and studying at a university with a very unique Computer Science curriculum provided me the opportunity to put my coding knowledge to work — developing and testing products for the team. I am a quick learner and can definitely learn new things if required by the position. I’m confident my skills will be put to good use and I look forward to speaking with you further about the position.</p>
